given N of (x, y) as vector v of (x, y)
let curx, cury for current iteration of x and y
let int r for result

sort v vector numerical order

for each v :
    if vy is less than cury :
        skip this element
    if vx is less or equal than cury :
        set cury to vy
    
    if is the last element :
    if vx is greater than cury :
        add cury - curx to r
        set curx to vx
        set cury to vy

return r

method 2

read line
save first pair

read line
for N
if this pair is in range
    add to the pair
if not create a new pair

for each pair
    add to its len to result
